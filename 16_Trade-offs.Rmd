# Trade-offs

**Learning objectives:**

- Understand the Trade-offs between S3, R6 and S4

- Brief intro to S7 (the object system formerly known as R7)


## Introduction 

* We have three OOP systems intdoduced so far (S3, S4, R6) 

* At the current time (pre - S7?) Hadley recommends use S3 by defaut 


## S4 versus S3 

**Which class to use S4 or S3? **

- **S3** is a flexible class, made of a list with attributes and assigned names, it consists of three main **components**:

     - Generic function
     - method
     - attributes
     

     
- **S4** has a more structured approach, is more formal, more strict, and more verbose. It contains functions for defining methods and **generics**. 

For example to define a class:

     S3: class() <- ...
     S4: setClass()
     
**S4 is a combination of increased complexity**, as well as S3, it allows for inheritance of both classes and methods.   
     
S4 is usually good for larger projects, such as **Bioconductor**, and complex systems of interrelated objects:

It minimizes code duplication (an example is the {Matrix} package), and makes it easy to provide a general method that works for all inputs.



## R6 versus S3

When starting with OOP the S3 class is suggested as a default for its simplicity. Then, the tendency would be to lean towards **R6**.

Example of S3: 
    
     plot(data)

Example of R6:

    data$plot
    
**R6** is built on **encapsulated objects**, rather than generic functions.   


**Big differences: general trade-offs**

```{r 16-Trade-offs-4, echo=FALSE,fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/16-trade-offs.png")
```

### Namespacing {-}

**Where methods are in the Space?**

- in S3, **Generic functions** are **global**: there is a **global namespace** (same verbs, uniform API). The negatives are related to **homonyms** methods.

- in R6, **Encapsulated methods** are **local**: objects with a **scope**


### Threading state or accumulator programming {-}


In S3 the challenge is to return a value and modify the object. This can't be done, it violates set guidelines.


As an example, see the **16-example_accumulator_programming.R** in the scripts folder.


Or a way to do **multiple assign** operators with the {zeallot} package.

```{r 16-Trade-offs-5, eval=FALSE}
vignette('unpacking-assignment')
```


### Method chaining {-}

Useful to compose functions from left-to-right.

Use of the operators:

- S3: `%>%`
- R6: `$`


## Umm... what about S7 ? {-}

```{r standards, echo = FALSE,  fig.cap = "https://xkcd.com/927/"}

knitr::include_graphics("https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/standards_2x.png")

```

## S7 briefly {-}

* S7 is a 'better' version of S3 with some of the 'strictness' of S4

* Compatible with S3: S7 objects are S3 objects!  Can even extend an S3 object with S7

* Somewhat compatable with S4, see [compatability vignette](https://rconsortium.github.io/OOP-WG/articles/compatibility.html) for details. 

* Note that it was previously called R7, but it was changed to "S7" to better reflect that it is functional not encapsulated! 

## Abbreviated introduction based on the vignette {-}

To install: 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("rconsortium/OOP-WG")
```


```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(S7)
dog <- new_class("dog", properties = list(
  name = class_character,
  age = class_numeric
))
dog


#> <S7_class>
#> @ name  :  dog
#> @ parent: <S7_object>
#> @ properties:
#>  $ name: <character>          
#>  $ age : <integer> or <double>
```

Note the 'class_character', these are S7 classes corresponding to the base classes.

Now to use it:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
lola <- dog(name = "Lola", age = 11)
lola

#> <dog>
#>  @ name: chr "Lola"
#>  @ age : num 11
```

Properties can be set / read with '@', with automatic validation based on the type!

```{r, eval = FALSE}

lola@age <- 12
lola@age

#> 12

lola@age <- "twelve"

#> Error: <dog>@age must be <integer> or <double>, not <character>

```

Like S3 (and S4) S7 has generics, implemented with `new_generic` and `method` for particular methods:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
speak <- new_generic("speak", "x")

method(speak, dog) <- function(x) {
  "Woof"
}
  
speak(lola)

#> [1] "Woof"
```

If we have another clasee, we can implement the generic for that too:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
cat <- new_class("cat", properties = list(
  name = class_character,
  age = class_double
))
method(speak, cat) <- function(x) {
  "Meow"
}

fluffy <- cat(name = "Fluffy", age = 5)
speak(fluffy)
```

"most usage of S7 with S3 will just work"


```{r, eval = FALSE}
method(print, cat) <- function(...) {
  print("I am a cat.")
}

print(fluffy)
#> "I am a cat"

```

## So... switch to S7 ? {-}

* Not yet... still in development!
